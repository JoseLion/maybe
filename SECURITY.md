## Reporting a Vulnerability

This project has Snyk and CodeQL configured on the workflow and running constantly to help prevent security vulnerabilities. However, if you were to find a vulnerability, please create a GitHub [issue](https://github.com/JoseLion/maybe/issues/new) explaining the problem. Adding as many details as possible will help to tackle the problem swiftly.

Given the vulnerability report is accepted, it'll have a high priority to be worked next. A new version will be released as soon as the vulnerability fix is merged. If the vulnerability report is declined, you can expect a clear and logical explanation, but if you think the reasons are not right or not enough, feel free to leave a comment on the reported issue.
